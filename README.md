# kinetics-project

This project was done as part of a chemical reaction kinetics class. Our team deduced the mechanism of an unknown system of reactions. The
controlled variables were a reactant 'A', a catalyst 'C', operating temperature, and sample rate. The output data from simulated experiments
was then analyzed using Python and NumPy to determine reaction coeffiecents and validate our model.
